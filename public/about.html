<p>Welcome to my website!</p> 
<p>I’m <b>Ehiba Ransom</b>, an aspiring <b>web developer</b> currently learning the ins and outs of building modern, user-friendly websites. This website is my personal space to showcase my learning journey, projects, and progress as I dive deeper into <b>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and beyond</b>.</p>
<p>In the course of getting hands on a tech skill to add to my portfolio web development caught my interest. I own a brand and would want my brand to have a cool website; that motivated me to get on the path. Right now, I’m focused on <b>learning front-end development</b> while exploring <b>back-end technologies</b> to build full-stack applications in the future.  </p>
<p>Here, you’ll find my latest projects, experiments, and challenges, each reflecting the new skills I’m developing along the way. My goal is to continuously improve, build real-world applications, and eventually help businesses and individuals bring their ideas to life online.  </p>

<p>I’d love to connect with fellow learners, developers, and anyone passionate about tech! Feel free to reach out or follow my journey as I grow in this field.  </p>
<p><b>Let’s learn and build together</b></p>
